After moving out of my apartment in DC, I finally figured out where all my “missing” socks had gone. Sure, there were a couple of singles I probably actually lost, but most of them were simply misplaced. One sock would be in the bottom of my dresser while the other was hiding in my hamper. Found one sock in my gym bag - the other was mysteriously tucked away in the back of my closet. Don’t even ask me how that one sock got stuck between the wall and my bed.

I went months wearing mismatched socks to work - but no big deal if they were both black, or if the designs looked remotely similar. I had bigger fish to fry, like trying not to get yelled at for being late again. But consequently, the mismatched socks would be on different laundry cycles and mismatched socks would perpetuate.

Sometimes, dating is like wearing mismatched socks. Sometimes, you settle for something that isn’t a perfect match. Sometimes, you know that it could have been a perfect match, but you get thrown in the washer when the other sock is getting worn and vice versa. Wrong time, wrong place.

My cousin once told me that sometimes relationships were like falling in love with a shoe in the wrong size. No matter how much you force it to fit, no matter how much pain you endure wearing something that is clearly a full size-and-a-half too small for you, it’s not going to work out. Yes, it’s a fucking great looking shoe and they’re all sold out in your size, but you’ll have to come to terms with the fact that it’s not right for you, it hurts to wear, and you’ll need to move on.

We were mismatched socks paired together by a desperate owner attempting to get to work on time. It was the wrong shoes for the wrong feet - but damn, the shoes looked great, didn’t they?

It’s tough finding the right match when everyone seems to be on different laundry cycles or the shoes you want don’t come in your size. But with enough time and patience, I’m sure the socks will eventually match and the shoes will be Cinderella. Or who knows, maybe I’ll be that one random sock that I could never find the match for and ended up throwing away. Some people are meant to die alone. Haha only kidding.
